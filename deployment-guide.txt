1. Local Machine Deployment:
- Requirements are managed through `requirements.txt`
- Docker and docker-compose setup for local development
- Redis integration for device cache
- Configuration management through environment variables
- Testing setup with pytest

Steps for local deployment:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run tests
pytest

# Run with Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

2. Gradle Deployment:
- Uses Jib plugin for container image building
- Configured for Java/Python hybrid deployment
- Automated build and push to container registry

Steps for Gradle deployment:
```bash
# Build container image
./gradlew jib

# Run locally
./gradlew run
```

3. Google Cloud Deployment:
- App Engine configuration with automatic scaling
- Cloud SQL (Redis) integration
- Secret Manager for sensitive data
- Container Registry integration

Steps for Google Cloud deployment:
```bash
# Configure gcloud
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project your-project-id

# Deploy to App Engine
gcloud app deploy app.yaml

# View logs
gcloud app logs tail
```

Key Security Considerations:
1. Secrets management using environment variables and Google Cloud Secret Manager
2. Redis security through proper network configuration
3. JWT token management for device authentication
4. Secure configuration handling between environments
